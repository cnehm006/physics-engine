# physics-engine
Making a physics engine purely using Java.

## Setup
### Using the terminal
If you want to run it from your terminal, compile all files with `javac *.java` and run `java SimulationFrame`.

### Using an IDE
If you'd rather use an IDE, unzip the folder and open it in your code editor of choice. Then, just run **SimulationFrame.java**.
